Example: last chapter of &quot;Sidooh&quot; listed in DDSMD is # 56, while in MC is #66.. whoa!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>MC cons / wishlist:</p>\r\n<p>- MC misses a &quot;zip chapters folders + rename it to cbz&quot; feature, so i have to do it manually (DDSMD contains this feature);</p>\r\n<p>- MC misses the ability to set the number of concurrent downloads;</p>\r\n<p>- a primitive way to bookmarks manga could be a nice add in ;)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I hope this post will be useful to you! Please keep coding this cool app :)</p>\r\n<p>-numbw</p>",

But I have reviewed your changes and they are quite similar. So I plan to keep mine, with some code from your.\r\n</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>Now, that you not think I don't read your code:</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>[YAXNode(&quot;DeleteChapterFolderAfterCompress&quot;)] - need something like this [YAXNode(&quot;DeleteDirWithImagesWhenCBZ&quot;, Default = false)]</div>\r\n<div>so old xml will read. Didn't you get any exception with new code ?</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>Instead new naming strategy I have added new checkbox which allow padding with zeros.\r\n</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>And numbers of zeros always based on pages count. </div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>Your code: </div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>if (Index &gt; 99) </div>\r\n<div>return Index.ToString();</div>\r\n<div>else if (Index &gt; 9)</div>\r\n<div>return String.Format(&quot;0{0}&quot;, Index);</div>\r\n<div>else </div>\r\n<div>return String.Format(&quot;00{0}&quot;, Index);</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>Mine: </div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>if (DownloadManager.Instance.MangaSettings.PadPageNamesWithZeros)</div>\r\n<div>index = index.PadLeft(a_pages.ToString().Length, '0');</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>When there are lets say 500 pages your code just generate: 001,02...009,010,011,...,099,100,</div>\r\n<div>When there are 99 pages you generate: 001,02...009,010,011,...,099</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>Instead my code in latter case generate 01, 02, 11, 99</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>Still I don't know if I really should only pad or pad always to 000. And what when there are 1200 pages ?</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>And about clearing folder after zipping. </div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>Your code: </div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>// delete zipped chapter</div>\r\n<div>try </div>\r\n<div>{</div>\r\n<div>if (DownloadManager.Instance.MangaSettings.DeleteChapterFolderAfterCompress)</div>\r\n<div>if (State != ChapterState.Error)</div>\r\n<div>dir.Delete(true);</div>\r\n<div>}</div>\r\n<div>catch (Exception ex) </div>\r\n<div>{</div>\r\n<div>Loggers.MangaCrawler.Error(String.Format(</div>\r\n<div>&quot;Exception, chapter: {0} state: {1}&quot;, this, State), ex);</div>\r\n<div>}</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>I strongly encourage to not delete whole folder without moving it to recycle bin. You need to know how stupid users can be. Instead we should delete all our images and delete folder only when its empty. And why not puts this code in upper try catch block</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>As for Manga Stream crawler, do you plan to make some tests :) in MangaCrawlerTest ?</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>I know this is tedious work but important one. If so try to test some finished chapters and some ongoings, there are often some diffrences when you click on last image of series, if you can click it at all.\r\n</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>Second, try to run _RandomTestAll, remove all other crawlers except your, keep it for few hours, analyze errors (stop test, see test results),\r\n</div>\r\n<div>and so on as you will be sure you can handle most on strange and stupid things.\r\n</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>Try to look for licensed series, adult series, series with volumes (one more level in tree structure), try if it's possible to remove empty series,\r\n</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>Surprisingly this tool should be used by owners of services to find errors, chapters without images, etc.</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>By the way how you get xpath from html, what tool you are using for it.</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>And last, but this will be my job, catalog needs some rewriting to be ready for new crawlers.</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>Well I have looked on manga stream www and its really simple, nonenthles some test are required.\r\n</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>Currently I plan to integrate your work, check all services, and repair broken one and release maintance release</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div><font size=\"2\" face=\"Arial\"></font></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",
