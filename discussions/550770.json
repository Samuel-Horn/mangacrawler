Ever since MangaTraders (and to a lesser extent, #lurk) have been unceremoniously shut down, I'm forced to grope around in the dark, and things are especially bad when I'm trying to find older releases.\r<br />\n<br />\nFor the most part, this software worked like a charm, except for these websites:\r<br />\n<br />\nAnimea - cannot list series at all\r<br />\n<br />\nFor the following sites, I can get the series listed, and the &quot;Visit Page&quot; button works; however, I cannot download from it (there's just a big red ERROR):\r<br />\nKissmanga\r<br />\nStarkana\r<br />\n<br />\nWhat I tested with: Nise Koi, chapter 129. I did not test sites that did not have this title, but except for Animea I can at least list the available titles.\r<br />\n<br />\nHope this helps!<br />\n",
