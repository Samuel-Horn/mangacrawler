    "Description": "There is a bug when selecting multiple chapters for download.\r\nThe program will keep re-download the first chapter in the que. (The page count keeps going up like 34/20)\r\nThe next chapters are not downloaded at all (stay at \"WAITING\" indefinitely)\r\n\r\nBut if I select chapter then click download one-by-one, the queuing works OK.\r\n\r\nAnd \"ZIPPING\" should be \"ZIPPED\" to make it more understandable.\r\n\r\nThank you for your program.",
