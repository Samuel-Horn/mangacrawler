    "Description": "Hi.\r\n\r\nFirst let me tell you good job for this program it has been working great when I first downloaded it. However, since a few months ago, it was starting to be a pain to get the download working properly. I mostly use Manga Fox and Manga Here as source for my download. A few months back Manga Fox just got deleted from my bookmark list, when trying to download from it I kept getting error. Now it's back, all my volumes are on bookmark, but I keep having this \"Error\" problem. This time however it's on both sites. It starts downloading and after 1-10 pages it just stops and shows error.\r\n\r\nI am not a but wiz kid about this programming stuff and I'm sure it takes alot of your time, but if you could look into this I'm sure a lot of people would be glad. \r\n\r\nKeep up the good work!",
